<section>

<ul>
<h2 align="left">What is personal data?</h2>
<li>It means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person</li>
<li>Personal data can identify someone's name, identification number, location data etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h2 align="left">Why is it important to protect your personal data online?</h2>
<li>1. Prevent identity theft</li>
<li>2. Defend yourself in legal proceedings</li>
<li>3. Protect your financial information</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 align="center">Having your personal data online is dangerous and it is important to know what are the ways to protect them so that your identity is safe</h2>
<h2>Here are 5 ways to protect your personal data online:</h2>

<ul>
<h3 align="left">1. Create secure passwords</h3>
<li>Many people use simple and common passwords, such as <strong>passwords</strong> or <strong>123456</strong>, which can be easily guessed by attackers. A strong password is usually long and contains a random mix of letters, numbers and special characters. This will make it difficult for someone to discover your passwords</li>
<li>You should create different and secure passwords for each account so that it will be more difficult for attackers to access your personal data</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3 align="left">2. Use a VPN</h3>
<li>If you need to use public wifi, a virtual private network(VPN) service will secure your connection by encrypting all data that travels between your device and the internet.</li>
<li>Additionally, by replacing your real IP address with the one of the VPN server, a VPN improves your privacy by preventing ISPs and advertisers from tracking your physical location and building a detailed profile of your online interests, habits and behaviours</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3 align="left">3. Set up 2FA</h3>
<li>Two factor authentication(2FA) increases the security of your accounts by requiring at least 2 forms of verification, such as your account password and a one time password(OTP). Even if someone knows your account password, they still can't get access without the second factor</li>
<li>Moreover, if you get a 2FA notification that you didn't request, it's a warning that someone is trying to access your account, so you can quickly change your password.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3 align="left">4. Limit the information you share online</h3>
<li>The less personal information you share on the internet, the fewer opportunities cyber-criminals have to steal your data which can be used for scams, doxing or social engineering attacks</li>
<li>When creating or updating online profiles, provide only compulsory information and skip the optional fields asking for details that could be used to track or impersonate you</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3 align="left">5. Be wary of phishing attacks</h3>
<li>Always be careful with emails, messages and websites that ask for personal information sice it could be a scam or phising attacks</li>
<li>Never click on links or download attachments from senders you don't recognise or weren't expecting</li>
</ul>
